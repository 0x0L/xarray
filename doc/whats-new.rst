What's New
==========

v0.3.1 (not yet released)
--------------------------

This is mostly a bug-fix release to make xray compatible with the latest
release of pandas (v0.15).

We added several features to better support working with missing values and
exporting xray objects to pandas. We also reorganized the internal API for
serializing and deserializing datasets, but this change should be almost
entirely transparent to users.

Other than breaking the experimental DataStore API, there should be no
backwards incompatible changes.

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- Added :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.count` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.dropna`
  methods, copied from pandas, for dealing with missing values.
- Added :py:meth:`DataArray.to_pandas <xray.DataArray.to_pandas>` for
  converting a data array into the pandas object with the same dimensionality
  (1D -> ``Series``, 2D -> ``DataFrame``, etc.).
- Support for reading gzipped netCDF3 files (:issue:`239`).
- Reduced memory usage when writing netCDF files (:issue:`251`).
- 'missing_value' is now supported as an alias for the '_FillValue' attribute
  on netCDF variables (:issue:`245`).
- Trivial indexes, equivalent to ``range(n)`` where ``n`` is the length of the
  dimension, are no longer written to disk.

Bug fixes
~~~~~~~~~

- Compatibility fixes for pandas v0.15 (:issue:`262`).
- Fixes for display and indexing of ``NaT`` (not-a-time) (:issue:`238`,
  :issue:`240`)
- Fix slicing by label was an argument is a data array (:issue:`250`).
- Test data is now shipped with the source distribution (:issue:`253`).
- Ensure order does not matter when doing arithemtic with scalar data arrays
  (:issue:`254`).
- Order of dimensions preserved with ``DataArray.to_dataframe`` (:issue:`260`).

v0.3.0 (21 September 2014)
--------------------------

New features
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- **Revamped coordinates**: "coordinates" now refer to all arrays that are not
  used to index a dimension. Coordinates are intended to allow for keeping track
  of arrays of metadata that describe the grid on which the points in "variable"
  arrays lie. They are preserved (when unambiguous) even though mathematical
  operations.
- **Dataset math** :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects now support all arithmetic
  operations directly. Dataset-array operations map across all dataset
  variables; dataset-dataset operations act on each pair of variables with the
  same name.
- **GroupBy math**: This provides a convenient shortcut for normalizing by the
  average value of a group.
- The dataset ``__repr__`` method has been entirely overhauled; dataset
  objects now show their values when printed.
- You can now index a dataset with a list of variables to return a new dataset:
  ``ds[['foo', 'bar']]``.

Backwards incompatible changes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Dataset.__eq__`` and ``Dataset.__ne__`` are now element-wise operations
  instead of comparing all values to obtain a single boolean. Use the method
  :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.equals` instead.

Deprecations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

- ``Dataset.noncoords`` is deprecated: use ``Dataset.vars`` instead.
- ``Dataset.select_vars`` deprecated: index a ``Dataset`` with a list of
  variable names instead.
- ``DataArray.select_vars`` and ``DataArray.drop_vars`` deprecated: use
  :py:meth:`~xray.DataArray.reset_coords` instead.

v0.2.0 (14 August 2014)
-----------------------

This is major release that includes some new features and quite a few bug
fixes. Here are the highlights:

- There is now a direct constructor for ``DataArray`` objects, which makes it
  possible to create a DataArray without using a Dataset. This is highlighted
  in the refreshed :doc:`tutorial`.
- You can perform aggregation operations like ``mean`` directly on
  :py:class:`~xray.Dataset` objects, thanks to Joe Hamman. These aggregation
  methods also worked on grouped datasets.
- xray now works on Python 2.6, thanks to Anna Kuznetsova.
- A number of methods and attributes were given more sensible (usually shorter)
  names: ``labeled`` -> ``sel``,  ``indexed`` -> ``isel``, ``select`` ->
  ``select_vars``, ``unselect`` -> ``drop_vars``, ``dimensions`` -> ``dims``,
  ``coordinates`` -> ``coords``, ``attributes`` -> ``attrs``.
- New :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.load_data` and :py:meth:`~xray.Dataset.close`
  methods for datasets facilitate lower level of control of data loaded from
  disk.

v0.1.1 (20 May 2014)
--------------------

xray 0.1.1 is a bug-fix release that includes changes that should be almost
entirely backwards compatible with v0.1:

- Python 3 support (:issue:`53`)
- Required numpy version relaxed to 1.7 (:issue:`129`)
- Return numpy.datetime64 arrays for non-standard calendars (:issue:`126`)
- Support for opening datasets associated with NetCDF4 groups (:issue:`127`)
- Bug-fixes for concatenating datetime arrays (:issue:`134`)

Special thanks to new contributors Thomas Kluyver, Joe Hamman and Alistair
Miles.

v0.1 (2 May 2014)
