xray: extended arrays for working with scientific datasets in Python
====================================================================

**xray** is a Python package for working with aligned sets of homogeneous,
n-dimensional arrays. It implements flexible array operations and dataset
manipulation for in-memory datasets within the Common Data Model widely
used for self-describing scientific data (e.g., the NetCDF file format).

For a longer introduction to **xray**, see the project's README on GitHub_.
